# Final Project

_Web Programming with Python and JavaScript_

## What it is
This web application uses the SolarEdge API to get the information of the energy generated by your solar installation.

## How it works
This website uses Bootstrap and FontAwesome as CSS framework and icon repository, respectively.

All HTML pages can be found in 'templates' under 'app', all CSS styles and JavaScript files can be found in 'static' under 'app'.

As an additional touch I added a settings page. On this settings page users can change their username, e-mail address, first name, last name, and/or password.
