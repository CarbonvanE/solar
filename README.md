# Final Project

_Web Programming with Python and JavaScript_

This website uses Bootstrap and FontAwesome as CSS framework and icon repository, respectively.

All HTML pages can be found in 'templates' under 'app', all CSS styles and JavaScript files can be found in 'static' under 'app'.

As an additional touch I added a settings page. On this settings page users can change their username, e-mail address, first name, last name, and/or password.
